# Tasks 
1. Could you write a function that calculates the factorial? 
(Hint: I expect the function to return 6 when given 3 as an input. 
However, if I provide a string value, it should give me an error message. 
I also expect you to think about variations of this and check for what should be returned in other conditions.)

2. Could you write a function that takes multiple variables or an unlimited number of variables as input and performs multiplication operation?
(Hint: The hint in the first sentence still applies.)
